# Notifications
Create an application, of which every time a new user connects to our server, everyone else connected via sockets will be notified of that person's arrival with the following message: "Socket ID MV72_Ja_oKBrFlqyAAAG joined us!" , as well as notified of their exit from the server with the following message: "Socket ID MV72_Ja_oKBrFlqyAAAG left us!". 

Additionally, include a button, that when the user clicks it, all other users on the server are notified with the following message: "Socket ID MV72_Ja_oKBrFlqyAAAG just triggered a notification!".
